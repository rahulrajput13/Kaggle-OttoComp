    "####  What are the typical post harvest concerns for farmers and what is the role of a collection center in integrating farm supply chains and improving fresh produce distribution ? How does the supply chain network for VFF compare with traditional fresh produce distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-harvest concerns for farmers typically include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Food waste: Fresh produce is perishable and can spoil quickly if not handled properly. This can lead to significant losses for farmers.\n",
    "* Quality: Fresh produce must be of high quality in order to be sold at a premium price. Farmers must take care to harvest and handle produce properly to ensure its quality.\n",
    "* Market access: Farmers often have difficulty accessing markets where they can sell their produce at a fair price. This can lead to low profits and make it difficult for farmers to make a living.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Role of Collection Centre**\n",
    "\n",
    "The collection center can help to address these concerns by providing farmers with a central location to sell their produce. This can help to reduce food waste, improve quality, and increase market access for farmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A collection center can also help to integrate farm supply chains and improve fresh produce distribution. This is because a collection center can provide farmers with access to cold storage, grading, and packing facilities. These facilities can help to extend the shelf life of produce and ensure that it is of high quality when it reaches consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**VFF compare with traditional fresh produce distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The supply chain network for VFF is different from traditional fresh produce distribution in several ways. First, VFF sources its produce directly from farmers. This eliminates the need for middlemen, which can help to reduce costs for farmers and consumers. Second, VFF uses a collection center to aggregate produce from different farmers. This helps to ensure that VFF has a steady supply of produce and that it can meet the demands of its customers. Third, VFF uses cold storage and grading facilities to extend the shelf life of produce and ensure that it is of high quality when it reaches consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of a collection center and cold storage facilities can help VFF to reduce food waste, improve quality, and increase market access for farmers. This can lead to higher profits for farmers and lower prices for consumers"

    "The selling price is high compared to what a farmer earns. But the actual profit that the retail store makes is only about INR 2.82 as the cost incured by retail store is INR 19.68 per kg.

    "* Price: If the price of produce is too high, consumers may be less likely to buy it.\n",
    "* Convenience: Consumers are more likely to buy produce that is easy to prepare and cook.\n",

This would adjust the undergae cost and hence the optimal quantity to be taken. while doing so we have to be careful to check that the demand at t should be more than the wastage at t-1 otherwise the product will be carried over to the 3rd day which we wanna avoid so will have to set that to zero. \n",
